Raining today, so I sat in the main hall (Hojo) to enjoy the Sosenchi Garden at Tenryu-ji Temple.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kyoto is no longer empty as it was in April, but since Japan is essentially closed to all foreigners there are a much more reasonable number of tourists around.  The people that would have been in this photo were removed by careful framing and timing... and Photoshop ;-)

Fireflies this evening in the mountains of southwest Kameoka - west of Kyoto, north of Osaka.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was really hard to shoot this, it was so dark. My camera’s electronic viewfinder was completely black. The environment was destroyed any time a car came close, which wasn't very often, forunately. This is several long exposures, shot on a tripod, at high ISO speeds, composited together.

As Japan reopens and gets back to normal - or what will be normal for quite a while - I’m noticing that numerous shops are missing, replaced by signs that say “For Rent.” I’m sure this is happening everywhere else, as well.
