Something different on this last shot from Japan (for a while)...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Some of the many local trains going in and out of Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, in this multiple exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More passengers than any station in the world pass through the hundreds of ticket gates spread across this sprawling station.

Went to Osaka to get a more definitive photograph of Osaka Castle, and I think this shot will serve that need nicely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather difficult to shoot actually, because the castle is lit &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; brightly at night. It required an HDR stack - three photos at different exposures, merged together - and much adjusting of different areas of the photo to create a pleasing balance. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Sofer</name></author><category term="Night" /><category term="Castles" /><summary type="html">Went to Osaka to get a more definitive photograph of Osaka Castle, and I think this shot will serve that need nicely.

I have been enjoying living in Kyoto, but I've missed watching a sunset on the beach. So yesterday I went to Nishiki Beach, near Kansai Airport in Osaka for this photo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is looking northwest across Osaka Bay at Kobe, from southern Osaka Prefecture. The sign on the shack says it’s a boat landing; as well as offering rental parasols, beach yoga and pilates.

&lt;p&gt;Below, a 180 degree panorama of the Kitasaga area, looking northeast from approximately the same location as the photo above. Daikaku-ji and Osawa Pond are at the left. You can see the farms in this area and the larger Hirosawa Pond (広沢池) in the distance. The buildings at right are Kitasaga High School.
